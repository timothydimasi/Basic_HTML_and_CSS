# Basic HTML and CSS
These files are my first attempts at writing in HTML and CSS. Many of them are incomplete projects that I will be adding more to in the coming months.

## Noteworthy Items

### My Portfolio Site
This is home to my personal portfolio which I will be adding more functionality to in the near future.
It was created with HTML and CSS.

### Final_Challenges
Towards the end of the course, we were asked to try our hand at styling/building elements.
Instead of doing them one by one, I combined all of them into a mock-fan page for the San Diego Padres.

### bootstrap4_project
This is a mock site I set up to demonstrate my knowledge of Bootstrap.

### One-Page Website
This is a site that is a work in progress.
It is themed for a food bank based out of San Diego.

### Misc
This is an unorganized folder with a lot of smaller assignments.
I considered deleting this since it's so scattered but figured I might need some if it later on.
